# Bosque Language Overview

The Bosque language is a hybrid of functional programming language semantics and a novel ergonomic block & assignment-based syntax. The language also provides a range of ergonomic features for writing high reliability code, such as Typed Strings, unit typedecls for primitives, and first-class assertions/pre-post conditions/invariants. This document highlights language features that are new (or maybe less familiar) that are available in the Bsoque langauge.
